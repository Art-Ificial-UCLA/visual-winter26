# Project Title
> **Art.Ificial @ UCLA** · *Quarter Year*
> A creative technology project developed as part of the Art.Ificial UCLA project track.

---

## Project Statement

This project explores how AI and curated databases can help filmmakers and creators quickly discover and apply cinematic “vibes” to their work. By generating cohesive packages of colors, music, sound effects, and visual references from a single prompt or theme, the platform makes creative direction faster, more accessible, and more intentional. The goal is to bridge inspiration and execution through an interactive creative toolkit.

---

## Concept & Inspiration

We were inspired by:

* Cinematic inspiration platforms like eyecannndy.com
* Moodboards and creative direction tools like Pinterest and Are.na
* The rise of AI tools that translate text prompts into creative outputs
* The desire to make cinematic storytelling tools more accessible to creators of all levels

This project asks:
What if you could type a feeling, genre, or cinematic idea, and instantly receive everything needed to create that vibe?

## What This Project Does

This project is a web‑based cinematic inspiration and asset discovery platform.

Core functionality includes:

* A browseable library of cinematic “vibes,” each represented by a visual thumbnail
* Each vibe contains a curated package of:
* Color palettes and cinematic color references
* Royalty‑free music tracks matching the mood
* Sound effects aligned with the atmosphere
* Visual references and imagery
* A structured database where each vibe is tagged with attributes like genre, emotion, tempo, and visual tone
* A user experience that allows creators to explore, discover, and apply cinematic direction quickly

The intended experience is for users to browse or search for a vibe (e.g., “cyberpunk,” “dreamy romance,” “suspenseful thriller”) and instantly access a cohesive creative toolkit to guide their editing and storytelling process.

## Current State

> Where the project stands today.

* ☑ Concept / exploration
* ☐ Prototype
* ☐ Working demo
* ☐ Polished experience

Optional: one sentence on what’s working and what’s still rough.

## Demo / Media

Coming soon.

Planned media:
* Wireframes (Figma)
* UI concepts for homepage and vibe pages
* Early prototype of browse and vibe detail views

---

## How It’s Built (High-Level)

This project is being developed as a web‑based platform combining design, database systems, and creative asset integration.

Structure includes:

* Frontend web interface for browsing and viewing cinematic vibes
* A structured database storing vibe entries and associated asset metadata
* Curated and aggregated links to royalty‑free creative resources (music, sound effects, and visuals)
* A tagging system that categorizes vibes by genre, mood, emotion, and visual characteristics
* The system is designed to connect creative intent (a mood or prompt) with curated creative assets, enabling faster and more cohesive creative workflows.

Design prototypes and interface flows are being developed in Figma.

## Future Directions

Where could this project go next?


* Prompt‑based AI generation of cinematic vibe packages
* Personalized recommendations based on user preferences
* Exportable color grading presets and editing references
* Integration with creative tools such as Premiere Pro or After Effects
* Expanded vibe database with more granular tagging and categorization
* Community‑contributed vibe collections
